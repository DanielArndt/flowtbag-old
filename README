2. Purpose----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The purpose of this program is to calculate flow statistics from a given 
   capture file. Flowtbag was designed with offline processing as the primary
   focus.

3. Requirements-----------------------------------------------------------------

   Currently, Flowtbag requirements are python2.7, libpcap, and pylibpcap.

4. Usage------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The program's usage is currently left undocumented due to the rapidly
   changing functionality of the program in its early stages. However, if you
   run ./flowtbag.py the currently implemented options should be displayed. A
   typical use case might look something like:

      $ ./flowtbag.py test.cap > test.out
